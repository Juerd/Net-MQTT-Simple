MANUAL INSTALLATION
    If you can't use the CPAN installer, you can actually install this
    module by creating a directory "Net/MQTT" and putting "Simple.pm" in it.
    Please note that this method does not work for every Perl module and
    should be used only as a last resort on systems where proper installers
    are not available.
